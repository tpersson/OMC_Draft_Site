We welcome contributions, but before you do, please read the following guidelines. Submission context \u00b6 Got a question or problem? \u00b6 For quick questions there's no need to open an issue as you can reach us at pylhc@github.com . Our Availability Please note we are busy people and developping omc3 is not our primary priority at work. We may take some time to reply. Found a bug? \u00b6 If you found a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue on GitHub. If you wish to contribute a solution, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix. However, before doing so, please read the submission guidelines bellow. Missing a feature? \u00b6 You can request a new feature by submitting an issue on GitHub. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal first, to be sure that it is necessary and appropriate to this package. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project. Submission guidelines \u00b6 Submitting an issue \u00b6 Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available. We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, of course, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it: please provide a minimal reproduction scenario. Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate or fix bugs without a minimal reproduction scenario, so if we don't hear back from you we may close the issue. Submitting a Pull Request (PR) \u00b6 First, search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort. If you do not find a related issue or PR, go ahead. Development : Clone the project, set up your branch and development environment, make your changes, and add descriptive messages to your commits. Please reference the issue number in your commit header messages so that your commits appear on the issue tracker. Build : Before submitting changes, please make sure tests pass and that the package properly installs. The project comes with a Makefile to help with this, you can get an overview of the available targets with make help . This is a mandatory requirement for your PR to get accepted, as the package should at all times be installable without trouble through GitHub. Pull Request : After having worked on your changes and pushed them to Github, open a Pull Request to the master branch. Review and approval by at least one of our team members is required before accepting changes. If new changes are suggested, make the required updates and push the changes again, which will automatically update your PR. After your PR is accepted by a team member, please select squash and merge to merge into master. Afterwards, you can safely delete your branch and close the issue. Python Coding Guidelines \u00b6 We strive to use a common codestyle for our software. Please follow these guidelines to keep code cohesion up, and git diffs down. Naming Conventions \u00b6 Overall, please abide by PEP8 : Module, functions, methods, attributes and local variable names: use snake_case . Example: segment_by_segment.py , get_phase.py . Class names: use PascalCase . Example: FileWriter , FixedTfs . Module constants: Uppercase words divided by underscores. Example: INDEX_ID , DEFAULT_COLUMN_WIDTH . Private methods, functions and variables: see above, but precede the name by an underscore. Example: _validate_index_type , _get_header_line .
